      <h3>Javascript and Frontend Development</h3>
      <p>
        I have many years experience as a WordPress and front-end developer, creating responsive websites of a high quality.
        In my past experience as a freelancer and working for agencies I have also obtained an eye for detail and appreciation for design,
        knowledge of integrating with and developing server-side, as well as knowing how to efficiently project manage and work with clients
        and colleagues successfully.
